# Proposal
For our final project, we are proposing to make an iOS chat app where people can search for a topic they would like to talk about and chat with an anonymous person. When someone types in a subject, it will be matched up with someone who searched for the same subject and they can chat about it. Everyone using our app will be completely anonymous. We are going to assign names randomly based off of the movie Reservoir Dogs.

Must Have:

Ability to chat with someone
Everyone being anonymous

Nice to Have:

Being able to search for a subject to talk about and create a chat room specific to that subject
Group Chat functionality
