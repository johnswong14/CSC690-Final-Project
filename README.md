# Proposal
For our final project, we are proposing to make a iOS chess game. We plan on using a cocoaPods library for the chess board and logic. We would integrate the back-end code that we made for our Online Multiplayer Chess Game project last semester, which contains sockets. We would need to add an interface and menus. Here are the features we plan on implementing:

Must have:

Playing chess with another opponent
Being able to create and join a game
Showing your stats of wins and loses

Nice to have:

Ability to change board and chess pieces
Integration of move history of the current game
Chess rating system that rates players
Messaging system
